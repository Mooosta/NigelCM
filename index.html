        <h1> <b> Niger:</b> Strive for Child Survival</h1>
        <p>From a country holding the highest child mortality rate, to one of the lower amongst the Sahelian country.
          Niger reduced the rate of under the age of five’s death down by three folds in three decades. This is a breakdown
          of child mortality and Niger’s strategy. </p>

    <!--Introduction-->
    <div class="introduction">
      <h2><b> | Child Mortality:</b> World’s ongoing issue </h2>
      <p>Child mortality is an ongoing world problem that’s often overlooked. On average, 15,000 children below the age of five passes away each year, 45% of the death are caused by infectious diseases. It’s an enormous number of new life diminishing yearly, where the majority can be preventable with better rapid access to modern resources such as education, food, medicine, birth control, and sanitation. Below is a comparative child mortality rate graph between Niger and the world average in demonstrating the amount of children death yearly.

        <h2><b>| Intervention Strategies</b></h2>
        <p>In light of having the highest child mortality in the world, Niger made major changes in health programme delivery, introduced Free Health Care Policy in 2006 as paramount in increasing the accessibility of health service to families, improved maternal coverage & child interventions. Below is the major intervention strategy that Niger government has undertaken: </p>
      </div>
      <div class="strategy-1">
      <h4><b>Integrated Management of Childhood illness</b></h4>
      <p><br>Increase medical resource and test availability. Such as malnutrition screening. Mass distribute of disease procurement: Insecticide-treated bed net (ITN) in preventing Malaria, Oral rehydration salts (ORS) to soothe diarrheal disease symptom. </p>
    </div>
      <div class="strategy-2">
        <h4><b>Anternal & Neonatal Care</b></h4>
        <p><br>Implemented ongoing maternal & child support including early & exclusive breastfeeding, a new therapeutic feeding centre for malnutrition, handout of an Antenatal Care kit that contains essential resource such as bednet, iron, medications and vaccine.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="strategy-3">
        <h4><b>Immunisation Campaign</b></h4>
        <p><br>Niger campaign has effectively reached target of provide more than 88% of children with vaccination <i>(Tetanus Toxoid, measles & DPT3Vaccination)</i>, the early intervention greatly reduced the chance of newborns impacted by infectious and other childhood diseases.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="strategy-4">
        <h4><b>Trained Community Support</b></h4>
        <p><br>Hundreds of healthcare workers were deployed for community integrated support disease treatment diarrhoea, malaria, and acute respiratory infection. Many essential family practice knowledge and training were provided at no cost: breastfeeding, use of ITN, ORS and hygienic habit.  </p>

        <p>Niger's ongoing participation in UN’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) aims to to reduce the Child Mortality Rate below 2.5% by 2030.</p>

        <h4><b>Closing the Gap</b></h4><br>
        <p>The prediction above shows an exponentially decreasing curve trend in Nigerien Child Mortality Rate. Despite the rapid mortality reduction over the past decades, it is still difficult to close the gap as there are many existing problems within Niger yet to be solved.   </p>

        <p>Niger amends a great effort in improving coverage and access to quality healthcare for decades. Despite the plausible progress as one of struggling developing country.
        Niger's Mortality Rate sustainability is volatile as it's a developing country that is dependant and unstable economy.
        
        <br><br>The sustainability of current Heath Policy & service provision is precarious increasing refugee/ fertility rate leads to excessive population growth, which places immense pressure on government on funding demand. Constant sustained food insecurity: recurrent droughts, increased food price & shortage, reduction of local supplies.
        Unpredictable GDP growth, health system being highly donor dependant. 
        
        <br><br>Not only sustain the country's current progress but continuing to build and further develop interventions that take into consideration systematic challenges experienced in Niger.</p>
